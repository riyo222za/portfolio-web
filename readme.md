This is going to be a build of my first portfolio website.
I will be starting with creating the nav bar and styling it using CSS basics.

    - Some concepts I will be applying here will be the use of flexbox and some image transitions.
    - I intend to have some social media links in the nav bar along with an AI generated image of a company logo that I designed.
    - the use of the VAR function in HTML.
    - Pre loading images into the file to make the transition a bit smoother.
    - Use of CSS reset file on all pages.
    - Application of adding a custom font to the webpage.

I will also be adding the other webpages that the menu will look at and then use that nav bar style for the CSS of those websites.

This will be almost a journal and description of what I am learning and how I am going to also keep track other than git on what I have done to the website.

I will update this as I make big changes to the webpage.
