Important tips you can use on any website:

    - Use a CSS reset stylesheet.
        - When you do this, it resets the styling of all properties!
            This means things like h1's, h2's, links, lists, buttons. EVERYTHING will look the same.
            The font size, weight, borders, background colors will all be exactly the same and will display nothing fancy.
            So you need to create a root styling for all of these.
    - Have a main.css stylesheet which can be shared across all the pages of the website.
        - What you will do with this is essentially control the overall styling defaults.
          Like the h1,h2, lists, links, buttons styling for the whole page from here.
          You will also create the styling for the header and footer here, as you can then use these across the pages.
    - Create a {insert page name}.css style sheet to control those elements of the content other than the header and footer here.
        - we can can then style those elements independently to the header and footer.

This is going to be a build of my first portfolio website.
I will be starting with creating the nav bar and styling it using CSS basics.

    - Some concepts I will be applying here will be the use of flex-box and some image transitions.
    - I intend to have some social media links in the nav bar along with an AI generated image of a company logo that I designed.
    - the use of the VAR function in HTML.
    - Pre loading images into the file to make the transition a bit smoother.
    - Use of CSS reset file on all pages.
    - Application of adding a custom font to the webpage.

I will also be adding the other webpages that the menu will look at and then use that nav bar style for the CSS of those websites.

This will be almost a journal and description of what I am learning and how I am going to also keep track other than git on what I have done to the website.

I will update this as I make big changes to the webpage.

I will be adding comments to some places in the code so I can reference back to what I have done there so the code might be a bit bloated.

The nav bar is now complete. I have added a lot of comments to the code so that I can refer back to certain sections for future reference.

I have structured it in such a way that I can use this for basic and generic websites in the future.

The nav bar actually has icons which link to my different social media platforms for professionals and is black and white and once you hover over it, it actually changes to color.

Started work on the hero portion of the webpage.

Added some more default styling to the header.css file as the rest seems to have reset all the 
default styling on the webpage.

I then added some background images.

I learnt that the calc function can be used to help with calculating where things should be.

After working on the hero section, I took it upon my self to add a log menu and page.
The purpose of this is to actually put this on the website and keep it up to do date with this file.
That took a bit of time and I created only the hero section of but haven't actually filled out any of the content there.

The Category section is now complete, I learnt a few new techniques for a dark hover effect.

I followed a tutorial and think I have a bit of a better way to actually design this, it is a little bit more cumbersome but works slightly better.

I played around a bit with the borders and also adding a gif as a hover effect which is pretty cool.

Next up is creating the about me section on the main page.

Just take into account there is a lot of filler information for the time being, like placeholder images and text.

Completed the about section.

Only cool thing of note here was creating "skill bars"
