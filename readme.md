This is going to be a build of my first portfolio website.
I will be starting with creating the nav bar and styling it using CSS basics.

    - Some concepts I will be applying here will be the use of flexbox and some image transitions.
    - I intend to have some social media links in the nav bar along with an AI generated image of a company logo that I designed.
    - the use of the VAR function in HTML.
    - Pre loading images into the file to make the transition a bit smoother.
    - Use of CSS reset file on all pages.
    - Application of adding a custom font to the webpage.

I will also be adding the other webpages that the menu will look at and then use that nav bar style for the CSS of those websites.

This will be almost a journal and description of what I am learning and how I am going to also keep track other than git on what I have done to the website.

I will update this as I make big changes to the webpage.

I will be adding comments to some places in the code so I can reference back to what I have done there so the code might be a bit bloated.

The nav bar is now complete. I have added a lot of comments to the code so that I can refer back to certain sections for future reference.

I have structured it in such a way that I can use this for basic and generic websites in the future.

Started work on the hero portion of the webpage.

Added some more default styling to the header.css file as the rest seems to have reset all the 
default styling on the webpage.

I then added some background images.

I learnt that the calc function can be used to help with calculating where things should be.
